## Usage

### Authentication
Calls to the Ovation API are authenticated by Bearer token:

 ```
 Authorization: Bearer <api key>
 ```

You can get your API key from the `api.ovation.io/services/token` service by POSTing your Ovation username and password:

```
POST /services/token HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Host: api.ovation.io

{"email": <email>, "password": <password>}
```

The response contains your API authorization token:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{"token": api_key}
```

## Running
